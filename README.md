<h1>Eleni's Hackbright project - Park Playdates</h1>

Park Playdates is a fullstack web application to facilitate connections between people with young children at local playgrounds. Finding community can be hard in this post-COVID world, especially for busy families with young children. This app aims to foster local connection by making it easier for people to meet and interact with others taking their children to the same playground through regional message boards. It also offers users an easy way to locate nearby parks.

<h3> Technology: </h3>
Flask, Python, JS, SQLAlchemy, Ajax, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Google Maps API, Zipcode API

<h4>Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt</h4>


<h3>Future functionality/ Ideas going forward:</h3>

* Since the message board is supposed to be used to facilitate play dates at local parks, I would like to add functionality to optionally connect messages with specific parks, so that users can search for others who might be going to their preferred playground. The local playground list currently includes the park name and address, and may in the future include more info about the specific park as well as all messages referencing that park once the necessary functionality is implemented.
* It would also be useful to let users save their favorite parks, and to potentially create hosted and/or regular playdates at the more popular ones. 
* Fine-tuning the search options is another possibility, either by reordering the search result list or by offering an option for more specific (i.e. address-based) searching, or both.
* Another potential future feature would be to allow private messaging between users, which could open up the ability to search for others with similar-aged kids, but Iâ€™m not sure I want to introduce private messaging, so it might instead become some kind of message-board search feature. 
* Later functionality may also include the ability to post in/read other message boards, and even for users to create message boards of their own geared towards a specific park, neighborhood or age range.
